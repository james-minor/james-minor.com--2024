# James Minor Portfolio Website - 2024

## Description

My 2024 portfolio website, created using Astro and Vue. I make all of my portfolios publicly available, but note that
I **do not** intend this to act as a tutorial, guide, or even to be considered the "best" way to make a portfolio website.
Nevertheless, feel free to use this as inspiration for any of your future projects. Prospective employers, feel free to
poke around here.

## Running the Project

This website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), running it locally is pretty straightforward. From the project
root directory run one of the following:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
